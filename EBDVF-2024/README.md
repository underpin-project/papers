- Call: https://semantic.internationaldataspaces.org/workshop-2024/
- 5 pages max. (A4, font size 11, in PDF format).
- Focus: 
  - to discuss different approaches for semantic interoperability in and between data spaces (e.g. ontologies and controlled vocabularies, SHACL shapes, JSON schemas, etcâ€¦), and 
  - to raise awareness for and discuss cross-domain (semantic) interoperability concepts (e.g. methodologies, vocabularies), and
  - to bridge the gap between such concepts, overall and particular in regards to standardisation.
- Topics of discussion are expected: 
  - Existing solutions for (semantic) interoperability from different domains (see above) such as
    - Vocabularies for data spaces
    - Tools for vocabularies and ontologies
    - Clearinghouse tools for vocabularies and ontologies
  - Overall Data Space tools and solutions for (semantic) interoperability
  - Governance models on (semantic) interoperability in Data Spaces
