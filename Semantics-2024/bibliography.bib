  abstract = {EU invests heavily in Data Spaces (DS) as a mechanism to enable commercial data exchange and therefore industry digitalization and proliferation of Data Science (DS) and Artificial Intelligence, in particular Machine Learning (ML). While DSs use heavily semantic technologies, that is limited to describing metadata, license agreements, data market participants, etc. I argue that using Linked Data and semantic technologies for the data itself offers significant benefits regarding more efficient data sharing and use, and improvements to ML and DS processes. I give an overview of the state of semantic data sharing in several industrial domains (Product Classifications and Catalogs, Manufacturing Industry, Electricity, Transport and Logistics, Architecture and Construction; and close with a brief overview of technological enablers required for Semantic Data Spaces.},
