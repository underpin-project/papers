  abstract = {EU invests heavily in Data Spaces (DS) as a mechanism to enable commercial data exchange and therefore industry digitalization and proliferation of Data Science (DS) and Artificial Intelligence, in particular Machine Learning (ML). While DSs use heavily semantic technologies, that is limited to describing metadata, license agreements, data market participants, etc. I argue that using Linked Data and semantic technologies for the data itself offers significant benefits regarding more efficient data sharing and use, and improvements to ML and DS processes. I give an overview of the state of semantic data sharing in several industrial domains (Product Classifications and Catalogs, Manufacturing Industry, Electricity, Transport and Logistics, Architecture and Construction; and close with a brief overview of technological enablers required for Semantic Data Spaces.},

Despite significant recent progress (eg in the KG Building W3C community group), semantic conversion still remains one of the difficult steps. We favor generation of semantic transformations from semantic models that are both sufficiently precise, easily understandable, can be used to generate diagrams, and are valid RDF to allow processing with RDF tools. We call this approach "RDF by Example" and have developed a set of open source tools at https://github.com/VladimirAlexiev/rdf2rml. This includes "rdfpuml" for generating diagrams, "rdf2rml" for generating R2RML for semantization of relational data and ONTOP virtualization, "rdf2sparql" for semantization of tabular data with Ontotext Refine or TARQL. We describe our approach and illustrate it with complex and high-performance transformations in a variety of domains, such as company data and NIH research grants.},

This page provides an overview to help you find the parts most relevant to your interests. The CSVW syntax specification describes a data model for tabular data. That is to say, it defines that a table is a collection of cells arranged into columns and rows. It also describes how to annotate a table with a metadata file to help processors parse and interpret the contents. The schema for the metadata file is provided by the CSVW metadata vocabulary. The vocabulary defines the properties that can be used in an annotation. This includes things like a schema of column descriptions, datatypes and foreign key relations. CSVW also defines how a table may be translated into RDF via the csv2rdf procedure or into JSON via the csv2json procedure.},

  abstract = {Data sovereignty is a central aspect of the International Data Spaces. It can be defined as a natural person's or legal entity's ``supreme authority with regard to the digital domain particular to themselves``. The International Data Spaces initiative proposes a Reference Architecture Model for this capability and related aspects, including requirements for secure and trusted data exchange in business ecosystems.  This paper focuses on the semantic interoperability aspects of data spaces, as interoperability is a key concern in data spaces because, simply put, nothing works without it. Further, interoperability can be addressed on multiple levels. The New European Interoperability Framework defines an interoperability model with four layers of interoperability: technical, semantic, organizational and legal. In addition to the new European Interoperability Framework [3], which is applicable to all digital public services, ISO/IEC 21823-1:2019 introduces a five-facet model specifically for IoT systems interoperability: transport, syntactic, semantic, behavioral and policy interoperability. Although they use slightly different names, both frameworks address very similar concepts. Semantic interoperability enables the exchange of data between entities using understood data information models (or semantic meanings) [8]. According to [3], [9], semantic interoperability is achieved when interacting systems attribute the same meaning to an exchanged piece of data, ensuring consistency of the data across systems regardless of individual data format. This consistency of meaning can be derived from pre-existing standards or agreements on the format and meaning of data or it can be derived in a dynamic way using shared vocabularies either in a schema form and/or in an ontology driven approach.}
